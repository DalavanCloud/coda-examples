Each of the fortran examples in the subdirectories have to compiled together
with the coda_fortran.c file and the CODA C library into an executable.

Check the example in your CODA installation directory
(<prefix>/share/coda/fortran) for the coda_fortran.c source file and example
Makefile on how to do this.
