This demo shows how to read the (complicated) SCIAMACHY Level 1b
product, by walking the states, and for each state, the attached
DSRs (which contain a number of clusters).
Readout values (in BU/s) are calculated for each DSR, by subtracting
dark current, dividing by the integration time and applying the bad
pixel mask.
