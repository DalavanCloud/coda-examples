CODA C examples for SCIAMACHY data
----------------------------------

* scil1b.c

This demo shows how to read the (complicated) SCIAMACHY level-1b
product, by walking the states, and for each state, the attached
DSRs (which contain a number of clusters).
  Readout values (in BU/s) are calculated for each DSR, by
subtracting dark current and dividing by integration time.

* scil1b-gnuplot.c

This program builds on the previous example and generates 'plot'
commands that can be read by the 'gnuplot' program. Run this
program on a SCIAMACHY Level-1b file and pipe the output to
gnuplot, to get a nice view of SCIAMACHY data over an orbit.
