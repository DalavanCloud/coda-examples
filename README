CODA examples
-------------

This repository contains a random selection of examples on how to use the CODA software.
The examples are grouped per interface (C, Fortran, Python, IDL, MATLAB, ...) and then per type of data.

If you have any good examples yourself that you would like to have included, please provide them and we will add them.
